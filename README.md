# Test Kitchen

Parallel implementation framework with two gate skills:

| Skill | Gate | Trigger |
|-------|------|---------|
| `test-kitchen:omakase-off` | **Entry** | FIRST on any build/create/implement request |
| `test-kitchen:cookoff` | **Exit** | At design→implementation transition |

## Installation

```bash
/plugin install test-kitchen@2389-research
```

## Flow

```

## Quick Examples

### Entry Gate: Omakase-off

**Trigger 1: On build/create request**
```
User: "Build a notification system"

Claude: I'm using test-kitchen:omakase-off.

How would you like to explore this?

1. Brainstorm together - We'll work through the design step by step
2. Omakase - I'll generate 3-5 best approaches, implement in parallel, tests pick winner

Which approach?
```

**Option 1 (Brainstorm):** Proceeds to brainstorming skill (or fallback brainstorming), with passive slot detection

**Option 2 (Omakase):**
- Quick context gathering (1-2 questions)
- Generate 3-5 architectural approaches
- Implement ALL in parallel via git worktrees
- Run same scenario tests on each
- Fresh-eyes review survivors
- Present comparison, user picks winner

**Trigger 2: During brainstorming (slot detection)**
```
Claude: What storage approach would you prefer?
User: "not sure, either could work"

Claude: [marks storage as architectural slot]

Claude: For authentication?
User: "no preference, you pick"

Claude: [marks auth as slot, detects 2+ uncertain responses]

You seem flexible on the approach. Would you like to:
1. I'll pick what seems best and continue
2. Explore multiple approaches in parallel (omakase-off)
   → I'll implement 2-3 variants and let tests decide
```

### Exit Gate: Cookoff

```
User: "Looks good, let's implement"

Claude: I'm using test-kitchen:cookoff.

How would you like to implement this design?

1. Cookoff (recommended) - 3 parallel agents, each creates own plan, pick best
   → Complexity: medium feature
2. Single subagent - One agent plans and implements
3. Local - Plan and implement here

Which approach?
```

**Option 1 (Cookoff):**
- Each agent reads the same design doc
- Each agent creates their OWN implementation plan
- All implement in parallel
- Fresh-eyes review, compare results
- User picks winner

**Option 2/3:** Single agent or local implementation proceeds normally

## Key Insight

**Skills need aggressive triggers to work.** They can't passively detect "uncertainty" or "readiness" - they must claim specific moments in the conversation flow.

- **Omakase-off**: Claims the BUILD/CREATE moment (before brainstorming)
- **Cookoff**: Claims the IMPLEMENT moment (after design)

## Dependencies

## Origin

The "Test Kitchen" name reflects the experimental nature - like a restaurant test kitchen where chefs try multiple approaches before putting a dish on the menu.
